# Diabetty

A full-stack mobile app in 2 variations: a cloud-hosted (with user-user connectivity) and locally hosted. 

A medication scheduler, health jounral and reminder mobile application. Client-inspired to build a complete yet simple medication app, while exploring creative illustrations - e.g. sundial representation of medication and diary journals.

Stack and technologies: **Flutter**, **Firebase**, Dart

### Features

### Enjoyable moments

  Mastering animation mechanics and math-based generation (escpially in the sun dial arc - inside joke)
- mathimatically caluculated positioning and animation generation.
